## 👋 Hi, I'm mossbiscuits 

My name is Landon, and I'm a PhD student at Utah State University, where I focus on formal verification, particularly in probabilistic systems. 

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
I mainly use Rust, Python, C/C++, Java, and Formal Verification Languages like Prism and SMT specification. I work mainly with tools like Prism, Storm, Modest, and Stamina.

## 🔭 Current Projects
I am the primary developer of [Ragtimer](https://github.com/fluentverification/ragtimer/), which is currently being improved and integrated into a new tool called Practice (under development). 
I'm eager to get more involved in the open-source community over the next few years.

## 💡 Interests
- Formal Verification
- Probabilistic & Stochastic Verification
- Machine Learning
- Web Development
- Mathematical Foundations of Computation

## 🎨 Hobbies
When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
- Cooking
- Writing
- Reading
- Graphic Design
- Drawing

## 🧠 Philosophy
I believe in producing provably-correct systems whenever possible. It's worth taking the extra time to design a system well and be assured that it will work.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or just want to chat about formal verification or any of my interests!
